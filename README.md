### Technical Decision
When planning the implementation of the video captioning web app, I carefully considered the technologies and libraries I would use to ensure a smooth development process and a robust final product. Here's a detailed breakdown of my thought process and planning:

## Choosing the Technology Stack
Frontend Framework

React: I chose React for its efficiency in building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Libraries

React Player: To handle video playback, especially for videos hosted on platforms like YouTube. It simplifies the integration of video controls and makes it easy to embed videos.

Styled-components or CSS Modules: For modular and scoped CSS, which keeps the styles organized and easier to manage.
Input Fields and Form Design
I identified the need for several input fields to capture the necessary data for video and captions:

Video URL: To specify the source of the video.
Caption Text: To input the text that will be displayed as a caption.
Timestamp : user can specify the time against the caption

## Component Design
VideoForm Component

Input fields for video URL, caption text, and timestamp.
A button to add the caption.

## VideoPlayer Component

Utilizes ReactPlayer to load and control the video.
Displays the video with the capability to pause and play directly from the player.
CaptionDisplay Component

Shows the current captions on the video.
Ensures that no two captions overlap by validating the start and end times.
Handling Captions and Validation
No Overlapping Captions: Ensure that no two captions can be set for the same timestamp. I will implement logic to check for overlaps and alert the user if there is a conflict.
Delete Option: Provide a mechanism for users to delete captions if needed.
Timestamp Validation: Ensure the timestamp inputs are within the video duration. If a user inputs a timestamp beyond the video length, they should receive an error message.
Future Enhancements
Automated Caption Generation
Integrate ChatGPT or another AI model to automatically generate captions based on the video content. This feature can be added as an enhancement in the future.
Handling Edge Cases
Ensure robust handling of edge cases, such as invalid URLs, overlapping timestamps, and ensuring all captions fall within the video's duration.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
